# Make Change

### Overview

My first project! Very similar to a cash register.



### How to use

You will be prompted to enter the price of an item.
You will then be prompted to enter the amount of cash tendered for the item.
Finally, you will then be given change in bills of twenty, ten, five, or one, and cents in quarters, dimes, nickles, or pennies.

### Technologies
